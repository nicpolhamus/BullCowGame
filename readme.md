# Bulls and Cows

***This game is a work in progress!***

Bulls and Cows is a word game, where you try to guess an isogram.
The game is called Bulls and Cows because of the following rules:

- When you guess a correct letter, in the correct position, you get a bull
- When you guess a correct letter, in an incorrect position, you get a cow

Here is an example!

Lets say our isogram is the word `planet`.
Our first guess is planar, which would give us the following amount of Bulls
and Cows:

- Bulls: 4
- Cows: 1

We got 4 bulls because we got the correct letters `plan` in the correct position.
We got 1 cows because the letters `a` are in the word planet, but not in the
right position. Also, this would be a false positive.

Have fun!
